# Decorator pattern

Decorator pattern mainly emphasis on the OO principle of open to extension closed for modification.

Consider a scenario where we are booking a car and we have to option for selecting the features in a car.
The total cost of the car would be based on the features we would select.
ex: cost of basic car is 2000$
adding features for this basic car model will increase the price of the car with a set amount lets say adding power 
windows will increase the cost by 50$  adding power steering will increase its price by another 80$ and so on.

How can we make use of OO principle of open for extension and closed for modification to implement such a behaviour 
without making any changes to the existing classes is the main focus point of the decorator pattern.
